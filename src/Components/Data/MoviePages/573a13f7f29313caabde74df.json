Christine's beauty salon is heaving with female clients: a bride-to-be, a pregnant woman, a bitter divorcèe, a devout woman and a pill-popping addict. But their day of leisure is disrupted when gunfire breaks out across the street. A gangland family has stolen the lioness from Gaza's only zoo, and Hamas has decided it's time to settle old scores. Stuck in the salon, with the prospect of death drawing ever nearer, the women start to unravel. How will the day end? Will they lose their lives for the sake of \"liberating the lioness\"?",
